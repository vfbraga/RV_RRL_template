# RV_RRL_template

Examples for the use of the Radial Velocity templates in Braga+ 2021

All the instructions are provided in apply_template_examples.ipynb JuPyter notebook.

The mpfit module is included in astrolibpy which is a free third-party package (https://github.com/segasai/astrolibpy), but cannot be installed with pip3.

The work is based on the ApJ paper https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac1074

## Installation

This package is not installed via pip, but by downloading the files to a local folder. Only the examples require Jupyter notebook, not the package itself.
